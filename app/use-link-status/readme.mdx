# useLinkStatus

The `useLinkStatus` hook tracks the **pending** state of a `<Link>`. Use it to show inline visual feedback (like spinners or text glimmers) while a navigation to a new route completes.

`useLinkStatus` is useful when:

- Prefetching is disabled or in progress.
- The destination route is dynamic **and** doesn't include a `loading.js` file that would allow an instant navigation.

## Demo

1. Starting from another [route](/), click the useLinkStatus nav item on the main menu. Notice the inline loading indicator next to the nav item before navigation completes.
2. Navigate across categories at the top. Notice the nav item is dimmed to show immediate visual feedback that an action is performed.

To produce the demo, some non-standard adjustments were made:

- The main nav link to this route and the tabbed category links disable prefetching.
- `loading.js` and `<Suspense>` boundaries are **not** used.
- The route's layout and category pages include an artificial delay.

## Pending UI design tips

- **Keep subtle and avoid layout shift**: Pending indicators should feel lightweight and unobtrusive. To avoid layout shift, keep them out of the normal document flow (e.g. `position: absolute`) or use a CSS approach that doesn't create an element (e.g. animating the `background` position of a gradient).
- **Handle fast navigations gracefully**: Prevent unnecessary flashes of pending UI on fast navigations by adding an initial animation delay (e.g. 150ms) and starting an animation as invisible (e.g. `opacity: 0`) or outside the parent's clipping boundary (e.g. `overflow: hidden` and `translate: -100%`).
- **Place indicators near interaction**: Visual feedback should appear close to where the user clicked or tapped. This helps reinforce the connection between the feedback and their action.
- **Design proactively**: It is fine to preemptively include pending indicators for key nav items even when most navigations are fast. If the transition is instant or fast, the indicator won't have a chance to show. If the navigation takes time for whatever reason, the user will get helpful feedback.

## Loading UI deep dive

Next.js routing is server centric. This has many benefits, but means navigations require a round trip to the server to get information about the new route.

Next.js alleviates this tradeoff through strategies like prerendering, prefetching and streaming. As well as API's developers can use like `loading.js` and `useLinkStatus`.

### Improving loading user experience

When a user navigates (e.g. clicking a `<Link>`), there are two phases before the navigation is fully complete:

1. **Pending phase**: Before the navigation and the browser URL is updated, **while** the user is still on the current route.
2. **Loading phase**: After the navigation and the browser URL is updated but **before** all content of the new route is loaded.

Next.js provides features and APIs to improve the loading experiences in both phases:

- **Prefetching**: `<Link>` prefetches routes to enable instant navigation. Static routes are fully prefetched by default. Dynamic routes are partially prefetched up to the nearest segment with a `loading.js` file. Including the segments fallback UI in the prefetch allows instant navigation for dynamic routes.
- **Pending UI**: Use `useLinkStatus` and `useFormStatus` to show visual feedback to the user during the pending phase.
- **Instant navigations and Loading UI**: Use `loading.js` to define fallback UI for a route segment. On navigation, this essentially skips the pending phase and immediately shows something to the user while the rest of the content loads.
- **Streaming**: Use `<Suspense>` boundaries to further split server-side work into smaller parts and show something to the user earlier in the loading phase.
